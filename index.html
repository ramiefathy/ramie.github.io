      <h2>Personal Biography</h2>
      <!-- Add your biography here -->
      <p>As a Resident Physician at Pennsylvania Hospital, I am passionate about public health, medical education, and patient advocacy. In summer 2023, I will embark on my dermatology residency at the renowned Johns Hopkins Dermatology.

Having graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 2023, I am a proud recipient of the 21st-century scholarship and an honored member of the Alpha Omega Alpha Honors Society. Throughout medical school, my research delved into medical misinformation online, telehealth accessibility, antibiotic overuse trends, and the cutaneous impact of COVID-19. I spearheaded a city-wide volunteer initiative to alleviate the pandemic's repercussions and honed my writing expertise as a contributor to ABC News's Medical Unit, Medscape, and other digital platforms. Additionally, I developed a medical education podcast, focusing on COVID-19 management.

Prior to medical school, I served as a Premedical Intern at UCSF Breast Care Center, focusing on the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of treatments in the Radiation Oncology Department. I also spearheaded projects to enhance patient experience and streamline hospital operations. My love for communication led me to serve as an editor and producer for UCSF's science podcast, Carry the One Radio.

In 2016, I graduated Summa Cum Laude from Princeton University, majoring in Molecular Biology with a certificate in Neuroscience. My thesis explored acoustic communication in Drosophila melanogaster, specifically examining female courtship song processing and its influence on behavior.

Driven by a vision to merge my passions in medicine, public health, and academic policy, I aspire to excel as a medical educator, researcher, and specialist in complex medical dermatology. .</p>
