      <h1>Biography</h1>
      <p>
                As a Resident Physician at Pennsylvania Hospital, I am devoted to advancing public health, medical education, and advocating for patients. In summer 2023, I will begin my dermatology residency at the esteemed Johns Hopkins University.

               In 2022, I received my medical degree from the University of Pennsylvania. I was honored to be a recipient of the 21st-century scholarship as well as to be inducted as a member of the Alpha Omega Alpha Honors Society upon graduation. My medical school research focused on medical misinformation online, telehealth accessibility, antibiotic overuse trends, and the dermatological effects of COVID-19. I also led a city-wide volunteer initiative to address the pandemic's impact and contributed as a medical writer to ABC News's Medical Unit, Medscape, and other online outlets. Furthermore, I created a medical education podcast that centers on COVID-19 management.

               Before attending medical school, I interned at UCSF Breast Care Center as a Premedical Intern, where I concentrated on the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of treatments in the Radiation Oncology Department. I led projects aimed at improving patient experiences and optimizing hospital operations. My passion for communication inspired me to serve as an editor and producer for UCSF's science podcast, Carry the One Radio.

               I earned my undergraduate degree from Princeton University in 2016, graduating Summa Cum Laude with a major in Molecular Biology and a certificate in Neuroscience. My thesis investigated acoustic communication in Drosophila melanogaster, specifically examining how female courtship songs are processed and influence behavior.

      </p>
      <p>
        Fueled by my desire to merge my interests in medicine, public health, and academic policy, my goal is to excel as a medical educator, researcher, and specialist in complex medical dermatology. \n
